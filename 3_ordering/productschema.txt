    "quantity": Number,
    "options":[{
      {
          "name": String,
          "maxQuantity": Number,
          "choice":[{
              {
                  "name": String,
                  "cost": Number,
                  "default": Boolean
              }

      }  
    }] 
}

According to me, the above should be the schema for a product.
1. Each product has a uid, name, description, cost and quantity
2. A product can contain several options
    2.1. Each option can contain many choices
    2.2 Each option has a name, maximum quantity defined. This maximum quantity can be set to any number and logic can be written on the UI to allow 
        user to select one or more quantity depending on this value.
3. Each choice has a name, cost (optional) and a default - boolean, set to true if the choice is the default option.
